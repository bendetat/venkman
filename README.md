Sound and lighting rig for a cosplay proton pack and neutrona wand.

This is just the electronics - not the chassis. Very early days.

## Bill of goods

- Arduino, probably a Uno
- DFPlayer Mini (MP3 module)]
- CF
- 4x 10 bar LED modules - blue
- 4x red LEDs
- 8x 220 ohm resistors
- 2x 1k ohm resistors
- 6x 8 bit shift registers (SN74HC595N)
- 9v battery clip
- switches
- probably a parallel to serial register (CD4021B)
	- or could use a range of resistors on an analog input
- perfboard
- wires lots of wires
